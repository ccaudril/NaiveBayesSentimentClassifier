# NaiveBayesSentimentClassifier
###INTRODUCTION
##Problem presentation
Given a database containing more than a million tweets, the problem was to create a model able
to decide if a certain tweet would show a positive or a negative sentiment. For this purpose, the
instruction was to create a Bayesian network to carry out this task.
In order to construct this model, it is necessary to create both training and testing sets. The first
one will be used to create dictionary and to determine probabilities used in the algorithm. The second
one will be used to test the model and determine if it is acceptable or not.
